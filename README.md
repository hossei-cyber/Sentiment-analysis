## Introduction

In this project, we leverage the power of AI and natural language processing (NLP) to analyze the sentiment of Amazon reviews. By training a machine learning model on a labeled dataset, we aim to predict the sentiment of new reviews accurately.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

To use the sentiment analysis model, follow these steps:

1. Preprocess the input text (e.g., remove stopwords, punctuation, etc.).
2. Load the trained model.
3. Pass the preprocessed text to the model for sentiment classification.
4. Receive the predicted sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral).

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation is sourced from Amazon reviews. It consists of a large collection of customer reviews along with their corresponding sentiment labels. Due to licensing restrictions, we cannot provide the dataset directly. However, you can find similar datasets on various open data platforms.

## Model Training

The sentiment analysis model is trained using a combination of machine learning algorithms and NLP techniques. The training process involves preprocessing the text data, feature extraction, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning. For more details, refer to the `train_model.ipynb` notebook in the repository.

## Evaluation

To evaluate the performance of the sentiment analysis model, we use various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The evaluation results are presented in the `evaluation_results.md` file in the repository.
