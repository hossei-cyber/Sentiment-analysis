## Project Overview
This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on Amazon reviews using machine learning techniques. The workflow outlined below details each stage of the project from data collection to the final reporting of results.


## Step 1: Data Collection
### Objective
To gather a comprehensive dataset of Amazon reviews for sentiment analysis, ensuring a diverse and representative sample from various product categories.

### Tools and Technologies
- Python programming language
### Importing the libraries  
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis => import pandas as pd
- NumPy: For numerical computing => import numpy as np
- Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization => import matplotlib.pyplot as plt | import seaborn as sns

### Importing the Dataset
- There are ready to work on Datasets available on the Internet, following I am sharing one as a suggestion, it has 4 product types (domains): Kitchen, books, DVDs, and Electronics, but feel free to find one, which you think is more relevant:

## Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
### Goals
- Load and clean the collected data.
- Identify patterns, anomalies, and derive insights from the text data.
### Tasks
- Remove duplicates, handle missing values, and discard irrelevant information.
- Tokenize text data into words or phrases.
- Apply normalization techniques like stemming or lemmatization.
- To have an idea, see the article on [Geeks for Geeks: Amazon Product Reviews Sentiment Analysis in Python](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/amazon-product-reviews-sentiment-analysis-in-python/).


## Step 3: Data Cleaning
### Objective
Convert text data into a numerical format that can be processed by machine learning algorithms.
### Techniques
- Implement bag-of-words, TF-IDF, or utilize word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe).


## Step 4: Model Definition and Training
### Approach
- Select and configure a machine learning model suitable for sentiment analysis.
- Use LSTM, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, or Recurrent Neural Networks.
### Execution
- Split data into training and testing sets.
- Train the model on the training data set.


## Step 5: Model Evaluation
### Objective
Assess the trained model's accuracy and generalization using the testing dataset.
### Metrics
- Evaluate performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.


## Step 6: Model Deployment
### Goals
Deploy the model to a production environment where it can analyze new reviews.
### Implementation
- Develop an API or user interface for real-time sentiment analysis.
- Ensure periodic model updates and performance monitoring.


## Step 7: Visualization and Reporting
### Objective
Visualize the sentiment analysis results and report findings.
### Tools
- Generate comprehensive reports summarizing the insights and outcomes.
